Are you having a bad day?
Sorry, I don't speak your English dialect, where is it from, sir?
Sorry, I wasn't listening. Can you say it again?
I don't care what you say. I don't think you're that bad.
I was just wondering if you were as nice as you are pretty.
You don’t really expect me to answer that, do you?
Excuse me, but did you actually just say… Oh, this is not up to cats!
I hope the rest of your day is as pleasant as you are.
I would explain it to you, but I don't have the time or the crayons.
I see what you're saying, but if I agreed with you then we'd both be wrong.
Whatever you say.
I’m sorry but I didn’t order a glass of your opinion.
Well, I think we’ve reached the end of this conversation.
Some people are like clouds. When they disappear it’s a brighter day.
You’re kidding, right? Hold on. You are kidding, right?
I understand you feel that way. Thank you for letting me know.
When I was a kitten, I heard these words from some alcoholic pity ass on the street, didn't know it was you. My condolences...
